[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gothick/pyventure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gothick/pyventure)

This is purely a personal experiment in learning Python! It's a
text-based adventure game, and has been written from the ground up by
me, a complete Python novice, with more interest in learning the
basics of the language than leveraging existing technology or even
best practice in writing textual adventure games. (Translation:
"Please don't laugh at my code.")

It's also not in anyway near finished, you can barely do anything, and
there's a good chance the current master version will be broken. This
repo is only really public because I don't mind thinking out loud in
public! ðŸ˜€
